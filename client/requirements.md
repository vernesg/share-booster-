## Packages
framer-motion | Animations for the cyberpunk terminal effects and transitions
lucide-react | Icons for the UI (already in base stack, but explicitly needed)
clsx | Utility for constructing className strings conditionally
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes

## Notes
The backend provides a streaming response for the share task.
We need to handle the stream reader manually in the component to update the terminal logs in real-time.
Premium usage count is stored in localStorage.
